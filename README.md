# 🛡️ WhatsApp Web Phishing Detection Extension

> **Real-Time Phishing Detection & Attack Type Classification for WhatsApp Web**

---

## 📌 Introduction

Phishing, scams, and malware delivery through messaging platforms have become one of the most effective attack vectors in recent years. WhatsApp, being a widely used communication platform, is frequently exploited through malicious URLs shared via messages.

Since **WhatsApp does not allow third-party extensions or plugins** in its native mobile or desktop applications, this project implements a **Browser Extension for WhatsApp Web** that performs **real-time URL analysis**, **phishing detection**, and **attack type classification**.

The system is designed to detect **zero-day and previously unseen phishing links** by using **multi-layer analysis**, instead of relying only on pre-existing phishing datasets.
